# Markdown to HTML

This is a create designed to take .md files and convert them into HTML files.

The scope of this tool is limited due to my incopitence.

This tool supports the following features

- Headings levels 1-6
- Paragraphs and linebreaks
- Bold
- Italics
- Bold Italics
- More to come, but this seems like a good starting point for myself

## Usage 

To run this tool run the executable with a path to a folder with a index.md file.
The tool will automatically crawl throuth the file system and include other .md.
All non text assets must be included manually; this tool only reads .md files and wirtes .html files.
