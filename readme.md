# Markdown to HTML

This is a create designed to take .md files and convert them into HTML files.

The scope of this tool is limited due to my incopitence.

This tool supports the following features

- Headings
- Linking
- More to come, but this seems like a good starting point for myself

## Usage 

To run this tool run the executable with a path to a folder with a .md files. The tool will take the contents of create an .html file from each .md file by converting the md to html then appedning a pre and post amble (contained in preamble.txt and postable.txt.) Any more complicated html will have to be inputed manually.
